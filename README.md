# ECG Emotion Classification
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human emotions from ECG signal data. The dataset is based on PhysioNet 2017, with each sample containing 2000 ECG signal values and one emotion label (0â€“4).

# Workflow:
Load and preprocess ECG data (physionet2017.csv)

Split into training and validation sets

Build and train a 1D CNN model

Achieve emotion classification from raw ECG signals

# Tools:
Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

# Result:
Model successfully classifies 5 emotion classes from ECG signals with good validation accuracy.
